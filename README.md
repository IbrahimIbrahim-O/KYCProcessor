# KYC (Know Your Customer) Application

This project is a KYC (Know Your Customer) system used for KYC form submission, confirmation, rejection and user crediting, allowing administrators to process KYC requests. it supports verifying and managing user identities. 

## Features

- **User Registration:** Users can sign up by providing personal information such as email, phone number, and password.
- **KYC Form Submission:** Users can submit KYC forms with their personal details.
- **Admin KYC Management:** Admins can confirm and reject KYC forms, including crediting users after successful verification.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure authentication using JWT tokens.
- **Validation:** Requests are validated for correctness before processing.
- **Role-based Authorization:** Only authorized admins can manage KYC forms.

## Technologies Used

- **ASP.NET Core**: Web API framework for building and running the application.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for data access, working with SQL Server.
- **SQL Server**: Database management system for storing user and KYC data.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for user authentication.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging for tracking operations and errors.
  
## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- .NET 6 or higher installed on your machine.
- SQL Server or a database connection string configured.
- A code editor (Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IbrahimIbrahim-O/KYCProcessor.git
   cd kyc-project
   ```
2. **Configure Database:**
   - Open `appsettings.json` and ensure the connection string points to your SQL Server instance.
   - If you are using SQL Server, set up a database, and update the connection string accordingly.

   Example:
   ```json
   "ConnectionStrings": {
     "DefaultConnection": "Server=your-server-name;Database=KYC_DB;User Id=your-username;Password=your-password;"
   }
   ```

3. **Run Migrations (If using EF Core):**
   - Make sure the database is set up with the necessary tables.
   - Run the following command to apply any migrations:
     ```bash
     dotnet ef database update
     ```

4. **Run the Application:**
   - You can run the application using the following command:
     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```
   - The API will be hosted on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

## Authentication

JWT tokens are used for user authentication and authorization. When you sign up or log in, a token will be returned. Include this token in the `Authorization` header of your requests.

### Example Header:
```text
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

## Authorization

- **User Role**: Regular users can submit KYC forms.
- **Admin Role**: Admin users can confirm or reject KYC forms.

## Logging

The application includes basic logging using `ILogger` to track important events and errors. You can view logs in your application's console or configure it to log to files or external services.

## Testing

Xunit was used for unit tests.

### To run tests:
```bash
dotnet test
```
